GopherDb is a lightweight embedded database engine written in Go, designed to replicate the basic features of MongoDB for local applications. It allows you to store documents in BSON format, supports indexes for efficient searches, and uses a query language similar to MongoDB’s. Additionally, it automatically generates the _id field for each document, ensuring compatibility with MongoDB’s data format.
